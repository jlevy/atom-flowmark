## Test document

This is a simple test document to verify Flowmark usage. It's sort of a "transparent box" test of the Flowmark auto-formatter.
Re-run Flowmark and compare output.

The [ways equity can be granted](#how-equity-is-granted) as compensation‚Äîincluding restricted
stock, stock options, and restricted stock units‚Äîare **notoriously complex**. Equity
compensation involves confounding terminology, legal obscurities, and many high-stakes
decisions for those who give and *receive it*. Blah blah blah and blah.

- **[Signing bonus](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/signing-bonus.asp).** Cash you get just
  for signing. (Signing bonuses usually have some strings attached‚Äîfor example, you could
  have to pay back the bonus if you leave the company within 12 or 24 months.)

- **Cashless exercise**: In the event of an IPO, a broker can allow you to exercise all of your vested options and immediately sell a portion of them into the public market, removing the need for cash up front to exercise and pay taxes.

## Wrapping tests

### Some wrapping

William F. Buckley Jr. was coming to breakfast. Buckley was born November 24, 1925, in [New York
City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City), the son of Aloise Josephine Antonia (Steiner) and William Frank Buckley Sr., a [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas)-born lawyer and oil developer. His mother, from New Orleans, was of Swiss-German, German, and Irish descent, while his paternal grandparents, from Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, were of Irish ancestry. The sixth of ten children, Buckley moved as a boy with his family to Mexico, and then to Sharon, Connecticut, before beginning his formal schooling in Paris, where he attended first grade. By age seven, he received his first formal training in English at a day school in London; his first and second languages were Spanish and French. As a boy, Buckley developed a love for music, sailing, horses, hunting, and skiing. All of these interests would be reflected in his later writings. Just before World War II, at age 12‚Äì13, he attended the Catholic preparatory school [St. John's Beaumont School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John%27s_Beaumont_School) in England.

### A few paragraphs and bullets

A good heuristic is to assume your readers will be **100% intelligent and 100% ignorant**. Of course, in reality, varied experience exists within an individual reader. Most people may already know *something*, and some people are quicker learners than others. Even world class experts most likely only really know parts of a subject, and contributors may have practical experience in one role--perhaps they have been an entrepreneur, for example, but not an investor. So writing with the assumption that each reader could be both has a variety of advantages:

- Assuming 100% ignorance will help people who think they know a lot about a subject understand **what they didn't know they didn't know**, and fill in the gaps in their knowledge. It encourages contribution from experts and people with practical experience.
- Assuming 100% intelligence makes readers feel respected, and feel proud to be associated with the material. It will incline beginners to contribute their feedback.
- Ensures that each reader feels capable of tackling a problem, specific or general.
- Ensures that each reader can embody a new way of thinking about a topic.
- **Encourages communication between beginners and experts**, which can be highly instructive for both sides.
- Emphasize confusions, overlooked suggestions, pitfalls, and misunderstandings that are common.

A lot has changed in the last decade.
We‚Äôre currently in a [seller‚Äôs market](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/where-we-live/wp/2018/01/10/what-home-sellers-can-expect-in-2018-the-market-is-still-in-your-favor-if-the-price-is-right/)
nationwide, meaning buyers are not favored in most markets.
Home prices last peaked in 2006, and are [up 6.7 percent](http://money.cnn.com/2018/04/24/real_estate/home-prices-rise-case-shiller/index.html)
this year (they‚Äôve risen [about](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPISA) [6% every year](http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-tax-law-home-values-20180102-story.html)
for the last six) and rising‚Äîparticularly in hot markets like San Francisco, where the average home sells in 21 days. Mortgage rates are rising, too, and fast.
From September 2017 to March 2018,
[mortgage rates rose from 3.78% to 4.45%](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/upshot/housing-sales-mortgage-rates-tax-law.html).
Ouch. Neil Irwin, economist and New York Times correspondent,
[explains](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/upshot/housing-sales-mortgage-rates-tax-law.html)
that demand for housing is going up as millennials age into their 30s, but the cost of
building new homes to accommodate buyers is rising as well.
The [tax law](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/irs-tax-return/2017-tax-reform-legislation-what-you-should-know/L96aFuPhc)
passed in February 2017 is expected to [slow rising housing costs](http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-tax-law-home-values-20180102-story.html)
for the upper middle class and the very wealthy.
The tax law‚Äôs impact on everyone else is mostly centered on the doubling of the standard
deduction for married couples (still 58% of
[first-time buyers](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/realestate/first-time-home-buyers-statistics.html))
to $24,000, which means the tax benefit of buying is
[no longer relevant](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPISA) for most people.

- When an investor is trying to get you to agree to a term you think is unfair, you need to protect your interests without sounding accusatory toward the investor: *‚ÄúSorry, I‚Äôm just inexperienced, I read/was told that it‚Äôs not wise to [term they want you to agree to].‚Äù* \[[Paul Graham, Y Combinator](http://paulgraham.com/fr.html)]
- When you want to test a VC‚Äôs interest to determine where to put your energy, you don‚Äôt want to sound desperate or pushy: *‚ÄúI know that you‚Äôre not likely to give me a strong indication at this meeting, but I‚Äôd love to know if this is the* sort *of opportunity you could imagine taking.

- [Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)](http://fairmark.com/general-taxation/alternative-minimum-tax/alternative-minimum-tax-101/) is a [complex part](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc556.html) of the federal tax code many taxpayers never worry about. Generally, you do not pay [unless you have high income (>$250K) or high deductions](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/congratulations-you-owe-the-alternative-minimum-tax-2014-01-14). It also depends on the state you‚Äôre in, since your state taxes can significantly affect your deductions. Confusingly, if you are affected, AMT tax rates are usually at **26%** or **28%** marginal tax rate, but effectively is **35%** for some ranges, meaning it is [higher than ordinary income tax for some incomes and lower for others](http://www.forbes.com/sites/feeonlyplanner/2011/12/16/the-alternative-minimum-tax-sweet-spot/). AMT rules are so complicated you often need professional tax help if they might apply to you. The IRS's [AMT Assistant](https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Alternative-Minimum-Tax-(AMT)-Assistant-for-Individuals) might also help.

- ‚ùó If you do get an offer, you need to understand the value of the equity component. You need quite a bit of information to figure this out, and should just ask. If the company trusts you enough to be giving you an offer, and still doesn‚Äôt want to answer these questions about your offer, it's **a warning sign**. (There are many [resources](https://blog.wealthfront.com/stock-options-14-crucial-questions/) out there with more details about [questions](http://www.inc.com/atish-davda/5-questions-you-should-ask-before-taking-a-start-up-job-offer.html) like this.) Information that will help you weigh the offer might be: *What percentage of the company do the shares represent?* *What set of shares was used to compute that percentage (is this really the percentage of all shares, or some subset)?* *What did the last round value the company at? (I.e. the preferred share price times the total outstanding shares)?* *What is the most recent 409A valuation? When was it done, and will it be done again soon?* *Do you allow early exercise of my options?* *Are all employees on the same vesting schedule?* *Is there any acceleration of my vesting if the company is acquired?* *Do you have a policy regarding follow-on stock grants?* *Does the company have any repurchase right to vested shares?*

- Finally, consider the [common scenarios](#common-scenarios) for exercising options, discussed below.

- ‚ùó It may not be common, but some companies retain a right to repurchase (buy back) vested shares. It's simple enough to ask, "Does the company have any repurchase right to *vested* shares?‚Äù (Note repurchasing *unvested* shares that were purchased via early exercise is different, and helps you.) If you don't want to ask, the fair market value repurchase right should be included in the documents you are being asked to sign or acknowledge that you have read and understood. (Skype had a [complex](https://www.quora.com/Which-valley-startups-have-a-Skype-like-repurchase-right) [controversy](http://www.wac6.com/wac6/2011/07/skypes-employee-stock-option-plan-worthless-only-if-you-quit-before-2014.html) related to repurchasing.) You might find a repurchase right for vested shares in the Stock Plan itself, the Stock Option Agreement, the Exercise Agreement, the bylaws, the certificate of incorporation, or any other stockholder agreement.

Venture capital firms fund companies-commonly referred to as startups-that have ambitious goals of being dominant high-value businesses in their target market ([market caps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) of >$1B and margins of >50%). These firms seek to make investments early in a company's life when stock is cheap, in hopes of holding through periods of hyper-growth in order to realize abnormally large returns (200%+).

- Preferred stock usually has a
  [**liquidation preference**](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidation-preference.asp),
  meaning the preferred stock owner will be paid before the common stock owners upon
  liquidation.
  - [**Liquidation overhang**](https://equityzen.com/blog/startup-valuations-and-liquidation-preference-overhang/)
    can occur when the value of a company just doesn‚Äôt reach the number of dollars investors
    put into it. Because of liquidation preference, those holding preferred stock (investors)
    will have to be paid before those holding common stock (employees).
    If investors invested a hundred million dollars in your company, your equity as an
    employee won‚Äôt be worth anything if the company is sold when it‚Äôs in liquidation overhang
    and the sale doesn‚Äôt
    [exceed that amount](https://avc.com/2010/10/employee-equity-the-liquidation-overhang/).
  - ‚òùÔ∏è Preferences are
    [notoriously](https://venturebeat.com/2010/08/16/beware-the-trappings-of-liquidation-preference/)
    [complex](https://medium.com/@CharlesYu/the-ultimate-guide-to-liquidation-preferences-478dda9f9332).
    Investors and entrepreneurs negotiate a lot of these details, including:
    - The **multiple**, a number designating how many times the investor must be paid back before
      common shareholders receive proceeds (often the multiple is 1X, but it can be 2X or
      higher).
    - Whether preferred stock is
      [**participating**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participating_preferred_stock), meaning
      investors get their money back and also participate in proceeds from common stock.
    - Whether there is a **cap**, which limits the payout if it is participating.

- **Secondary buyers**: Thinking on all this
  [has evolved](http://www.industryventures.com/2014/12/02/employee-liquidity-good-for-private-companies/)
  [in recent years](https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/14/selling-private-company-shares-2-0/).
  Some companies do see value in offering (mostly limited) opportunities for sale.
  		\- [SharesPost](http://sharespost.com/), [Equidate](https://www.equidateinc.com/), and
    [EquityZen](https://equityzen.com/) have sought to establish a market around secondary sales,
    particularly for well-known pre-IPO companies.

- **NSOs**: You pay full taxes at exercise, and the sale is like any investment gain:
  - At grant and vesting:
    - No tax if granted at FMV
  - At exercise:
    - Ordinary tax on the bargain element
    - Income and employment tax withholding on paycheck
  - At sale:
    - Long-term capital gains tax on gain if held for *1 year past exercise*
    - Ordinary tax otherwise (including immediate sale)

- **ISOs**: You might pay less tax at exercise, but it‚Äôs complicated:
  - At grant and vesting:
    - No tax if granted at FMV
  - At exercise:
    - AMT tax event on the bargain element;
      no ordinary or capital gains tax
    - No income or employment tax withholding on paycheck
  - At sale:
    - Long-term capital gains if held for *1 year past exercise and 2 years past grant date*
    - Ordinary tax otherwise (including immediate sale)

ElastiCache Basics:

- üìí [Homepage](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/) ‚àô [User
  guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/UserGuide) ‚àô
  [FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/faqs/) ‚àô
  [Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/pricing/)
- **ElastiCache** is a managed in-memory cache service, that can be used to
  store temporary data in a fast in-memory cache, typically in order to avoid
  repeating the same computation multiple times when it could be reused.
- It supports both the [Memcached](https://memcached.org) and
  [Redis](https://redis.io) open source in-memory cache software and exposes
  them both using their native access APIs.
- The main benefit is that AWS takes care of running, patching and optimizing
  the cache nodes for you, so you just need to launch a cluster and configure
  its endpoint in your application, while AWS will take of most of the operational
  work of running the cache nodes.

DynamoDB Basics:

- üìí [Homepage](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) ‚àô [Developer guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/) ‚àô [FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/faqs/) ‚àô [Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/)
- **DynamoDB** is a [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) database with focuses on speed, flexibility, and scalability. DynamoDB is priced on a combination of throughput and storage.

ElastiCache Tips:

- Choose the
  [engine](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/UserGuide/SelectEngine.html),
  clustering configuration and [instance
  type](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/UserGuide/CacheNodes.SelectSize.html)
  carefully based on your application needs. The documentation explains in
  detail the pros, cons and limitations of each engine in order to help you
  choose the best fit for your application. In a nutshell, Redis is
  preferable for storing more complex data structures, while Memcached is just a
  plain key/value store. The simplicity of Memcached allows it to be slightly
  faster and allows it to scale out if needed, but Redis has more features which
  you may use in your application.
- For Memcached AWS provides enhanced SDKs for certain programming languages
  which implement
  [auto-discovery](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/UserGuide/AutoDiscovery.html),
  a feature not available in the normal memcached client libraries.

**CEOs** and **COOs** who run a company or team of significant size should be sure to talk to
an equity compensation consultant or specialist at a law firm. **Founders** looking for an
introduction to legalities of running a company may wish to check out Clerky‚Äôs
[*Legal Concepts for Founders*](https://handbook.clerky.com/).

This number has steadily declined since 2002 levels of 12.3% and 23.2% respectively ([NCEO analysis](https://www.nceo.org/assets/pdf/articles/GSS-2014-data.pdf)
of General Social Survey data).

## Footnotes and bare links

üî∏ If you do send a pitch deck via email, expect materials you share with investors to get
leaked to other investors, your competitors, and the press.[^paulgraham.mscnvt] That doesn‚Äôt mean you
shouldn‚Äôt tell investors what they need to know, but it does mean you want to be careful
with how you share that information.
You might, for example, send investors a less sensitive version of your pitch deck via
email, but include additional slides when you actually present to them at their firm.

To create an effective story, you have to consider what motivates the recipient of your story. Take Henry Ford, ‚ÄúIf there is any one secret of success it lies in the ability to get the other person‚Äôs point of view and see things from their angle as well as your own.‚Äù [^carnegieda.327r3k]

Spacing around footnotes can be confusing.[^a.missing] Like this.[^a.missing][^b.missing] Or. [^a.missing] [^b.missing] This. [^a.missing][^b.missing][^c.missing]

‚ùóÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è Having multiple automatic conversion thresholds can give the investor with a higher threshold leverage to block an IPO.[^fm16p80.lm4ika]

[^thedistinc.pc5o6n.orphan]: The distinction between ‚Äúhiring‚Äù and ‚Äúrecruiting‚Äù isn‚Äôt universally agreed upon. Some people think of hiring as a superset of recruiting, some consider it to be the other way around. However you think of it, both recruiting and hiring involve selling candidates on the value proposition of a company and ensuring the alignment of interests between the two parties.

And by contrast here a bare link is like this <https://www.google.com/>
