## Test document

This is a simple test document to verify Flowmark usage.
It‚Äôs sort of a ‚Äútransparent box‚Äù test of the Flowmark auto-formatter.
Re-run Flowmark and compare output.

## Some apostrophes and quotes‚Äîand dashes, too

‚ÄúHello,‚Äù he said!
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ your specialty (if I may ask)?‚Äù

Cas' surprise at John‚Äôs question hung over them both for a brief moment, like a thinly
disguised sack of potatoes.
‚ÄúFrom 2002‚Äì2004 I specialized in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (Pub.L. 107‚Äì204, 116 Stat.

Accountability, Responsibility, and Transparency Act‚Äô and‚Äî‚Äù But here he cut her off!
And who could blame him?
There was no time to lose.

### A few paragraphs and bullets

A good heuristic is to assume your readers will be **100% intelligent and 100% ignorant**.
Of course, in reality, varied experience exists within an individual reader.
Most people may already know *something*, and some people are quicker learners than
others. Even world class experts most likely only really know parts of a subject, and
contributors may have practical experience in one role‚Äîperhaps they have been an
entrepreneur, for example, but not an investor.
So writing with the assumption that each reader could be both has a variety of
advantages:

- Assuming 100% ignorance will help people who think they know a lot about a subject
  understand **what they didn‚Äôt know they didn‚Äôt know**, and fill in the gaps in their
  knowledge. It encourages contribution from experts and people with practical experience.
- Assuming 100% intelligence makes readers feel respected, and feel proud to be associated
  with the material.
  It will incline beginners to contribute their feedback.
- Ensures that each reader feels capable of tackling a problem, specific or general.
- Ensures that each reader can embody a new way of thinking about a topic.
- **Encourages communication between beginners and experts**, which can be highly instructive
  for both sides.
- Emphasize confusions, overlooked suggestions, pitfalls, and misunderstandings that are
  common.

- For well-known people, places, things, and events, prefer linking to the **Wikipedia page**.
  - If there is a good quality Wikipedia page, prefer it to company or organization home
    pages, home pages of cities or states or agencies, and other things notable enough to be
    covered well.
  - Why? It usually gives a lot more context to the reader, and saves them having to Google to
    find it. It will also help with our search and web page snippet features, since the
    mouseovers on the links will be better quality than for those on marketing pages or poorly
    organized or out-of-date official websites.

- [Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)](http://fairmark.com/general-taxation/alternative-minimum-tax/alternative-minimum-tax-101/)
  is a [complex part](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc556.html) of the federal tax code
  many taxpayers never worry about.
  Generally, you do not pay
  [unless you have high income (>$250K) or high deductions](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/congratulations-you-owe-the-alternative-minimum-tax-2014-01-14).
  It also depends on the state you‚Äôre in, since your state taxes can significantly affect
  your deductions.
  Confusingly, if you are affected, AMT tax rates are usually at **26%** or **28%** marginal tax
  rate, but effectively is **35%** for some ranges, meaning it is
  [higher than ordinary income tax for some incomes and lower for others](http://www.forbes.com/sites/feeonlyplanner/2011/12/16/the-alternative-minimum-tax-sweet-spot/).
  AMT rules are so complicated you often need professional tax help if they might apply to
  you. The IRS‚Äôs
  [AMT Assistant](https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Alternative-Minimum-Tax-(AMT)-Assistant-for-Individuals)
  might also help.

- ‚ùó If you do get an offer, you need to understand the value of the equity component.
  You need quite a bit of information to figure this out, and should just ask.
  If the company trusts you enough to be giving you an offer, and still doesn‚Äôt want to
  answer these questions about your offer, it‚Äôs **a warning sign**. (There are many
  [resources](https://blog.wealthfront.com/stock-options-14-crucial-questions/) out there
  with more details about
  [questions](http://www.inc.com/atish-davda/5-questions-you-should-ask-before-taking-a-start-up-job-offer.html)
  like this.) Information that will help you weigh the offer might be: *
  What percentage of the company do the shares represent?*
  *What set of shares was used to compute that percentage (is this really the percentage of
  all shares, or some subset)?*
  *What did the last round value the company at?
  (I.e. the preferred share price times the total outstanding shares)?*
  *What is the most recent 409A valuation?
  When was it done, and will it be done again soon?*
  *Do you allow early exercise of my options?*
  *Are all employees on the same vesting schedule?*
  *Is there any acceleration of my vesting if the company is acquired?*
  *Do you have a policy regarding follow-on stock grants?*
  *Does the company have any repurchase right to vested shares?*
- Finally, consider the [common scenarios](#common-scenarios) for exercising options,
  discussed below.

- ‚ùó It may not be common, but some companies retain a right to repurchase (buy back) vested
  shares. It‚Äôs simple enough to ask, "Does the company have any repurchase right to *vested*
  shares?‚Äù (Note repurchasing *unvested* shares that were purchased via early exercise is
  different, and helps you.)
  If you don‚Äôt want to ask, the fair market value repurchase right should be included in the
  documents you are being asked to sign or acknowledge that you have read and understood.
  (Skype had a
  [complex](https://www.quora.com/Which-valley-startups-have-a-Skype-like-repurchase-right)
  [controversy](http://www.wac6.com/wac6/2011/07/skypes-employee-stock-option-plan-worthless-only-if-you-quit-before-2014.html)
  related to repurchasing.)
  You might find a repurchase right for vested shares in the Stock Plan itself, the Stock
  Option Agreement, the Exercise Agreement, the bylaws, the certificate of incorporation, or
  any other stockholder agreement.

ElastiCache Basics:

  [FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/faqs/) ‚àô
  [Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/pricing/)
- **ElastiCache** is a managed in-memory cache service, that can be used to store temporary
  data in a fast in-memory cache, typically in order to avoid repeating the same computation
  multiple times when it could be reused.
- It supports both the [Memcached](https://memcached.org) and [Redis](https://redis.io)
  open source in-memory cache software and exposes them both using their native access
  APIs.
- The main benefit is that AWS takes care of running, patching and optimizing the cache
  nodes for you, so you just need to launch a cluster and configure its endpoint in your
  application, while AWS will take of most of the operational work of running the cache
  nodes.

DynamoDB Basics:

  [Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/)
- **DynamoDB** is a [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) database with focuses on
  speed, flexibility, and scalability.
  DynamoDB is priced on a combination of throughput and storage.

ElastiCache Tips:

- Choose the
  [engine](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/UserGuide/SelectEngine.html),
  clustering configuration and
  [instance type](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/UserGuide/CacheNodes.SelectSize.html)
  carefully based on your application needs.
  The documentation explains in detail the pros, cons and limitations of each engine in
  order to help you choose the best fit for your application.
  In a nutshell, Redis is preferable for storing more complex data structures, while
  Memcached is just a plain key/value store.
  The simplicity of Memcached allows it to be slightly faster and allows it to scale out if
  needed, but Redis has more features which you may use in your application.
- For Memcached AWS provides enhanced SDKs for certain programming languages which
  implement
  [auto-discovery](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/UserGuide/AutoDiscovery.html),
  a feature not available in the normal memcached client libraries.
